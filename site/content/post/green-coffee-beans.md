Green coffee beans are the raw seeds of coffee cherries that have been separated or “processed” and have yet to be roasted. All of a coffee’s taste and flavour potential is held within this green seed. This potential is ultimately unleashed through roasting the green coffee.

## From the coffee tree to your cup

Once the cherries are harvested from coffee trees, they are processed in several ways, depending on the coffee’s origin. Three of the most common approaches to processing are: washed, semi-washed and naturally-processed. The end result of each is that the fruit of the coffee cherry is stripped away, leaving only the green coffee. Each method of processing contributes to the final taste you’ll experience when you drink it. But before it’s enjoyed in a cup of coffee, the beans have to be roasted.

Coffee roasting is the process that brings out the flavours we look for in coffee. During roasting, the beans go through a chemical reaction called the “Maillard reaction” which causes sugar browning, caramelisation and all-around deliciousness. We roast green coffee beans to bring out its aroma, acidity, body and flavour. Each coffee is roasted to a unique taste profile to highlight these inherent flavour characteristics: that is why roasting is a true craft. Our roasters are skilled at roasting to bring out the potential of each distinctive green coffee.

## Plan a trek to our coffee farm

Milche is considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Milche trek is a 15km hike to the peak and consists of a 900 meters increase in elevation. The local prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 7 hours hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, stunning Himalayan mountains views will take your breath away.
