    we’re glad to pass that knowledge to anyone.

        Our Green Coffee Beans are grown on the higher altitude of Milche, one of
        the highland that make up Nepal and are considered one of the
        world's finest coffees. Roast them to your tastes.

        Darker Roasted Coffee Beans possess the characteristically sharp, winey
        acidity typical of Himalayan Arabica coffees. This blend is medium to
        full body and fairly rich in flavor.

        Nepal produces less than one percent of the world's coffee, and most
        of it is drunk by the Nepalese themselves. Our Lighter Roasted Coffee
        Beans are a medium bodied coffee with a sweetly pleasant flavor.

        Blend Roasted Coffee Beans give you that strong Himalayan flavor with
        that rich and smooth Nepalese Roast to balance it out. This makes for a
        sleek and strong pot of coffee.

      I'm a reseller of Thapa coffee beans in Malaysia. The first time I tried
      Thapa's coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was the same thing I’ve been
      drinking every morning. My customers too love it so much.
